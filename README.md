Made from this challenge https://devchallenges.io/challenges/3JFYedSOZqAxYuOCNmYD using React. ContextAPI was also used.

It's a airbnb lookalike.

Issues to be fixed:

1. top-left and bottom-left corners of the search bar are cut off.
2. sometimes the state value of the guest count lags behind by 1 when incremented using buttons.
